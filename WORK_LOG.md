| Oct. 25 | 11:40-12:00am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I started thinking about it and my first idea is to create my own hash to filter inputs into groups that should hopefully be equally likely to be in. I remember talking about this super briefly last year, but I don't remember the context to it. |
| Oct. 29 |  9:00-9:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I tried a few different ways to create a filtering system for the buckets, and I decided on adding up the ASCII values of each character in the string(I'm choosing to make it a string for now), then seeing what the remainder is after dividing by 3. I can change the 3 pretty easily, and I figure this should make the groups pretty even. |

So I changed it from the DNA reader with the while loop. I also realized that I wasn't able to get the values from the keys when querying, so I tried to make a map of size 2 but I couldn't figure out how to get the syntax working. |
| Oct. 30 | 9:00-10:00am  | I now have all of the test cases except products working. I created a class to hold the pair of keys and values, but I realized I don't really need it, I could just use an array of size two. Right now, I'm pretty sure the reason testProducts doesn't work is because of the spread of the items. I changed my hash function to also accept numbers and just use their numerical value (I'm probably going to change this back, it makes it very slow) because I thought the extra zeros before each serial code was useless. But, it's still running into the same problem because the dataset is very concentrated with some numbers and not so much with others, so the map is not very even. |

I made the hashing back into Horner's method, and I also made a new class for the hashmap. I'm changing the way I make the map and create things to make it the linear probing technique. |

When I was resizing I realized that I was overwriting items because I wasn't using my method I had made. Now it passes all tests except products. Again. |

I realized I was adding too many values to my numItems, but when I fixed that, it still didn't seem to change anything. I tried changing the initial size, and even though I only changed it by like 9, it greatly slowed down the runtime. |

I tried a few different ones and I like 43 the best right now. |

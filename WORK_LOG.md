I remember talking about this super briefly last year, but I don't remember the context to it. |
| Oct. 29 |  9:00-9:30pm  | I tried a few different ways to create a filtering system for the buckets, and I decided on adding up the ASCII values of each character in the string(I'm choosing to make it a string for now), then seeing what the remainder is after dividing by 3. I can change the 3 pretty easily, and I figure this should make the groups pretty even. |
